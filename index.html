	    Hello, my name is Feiyang Jin, a first year PhD student at Georgia Tech. My advisor is <a href="https://vsarkar.cc.gatech.edu/">Vivek Sarkar</a> <br><br>

   		My research focuses on Parallel Computing. The problems I look at include but not limited to race detection, deadlock-prevention, algorithms, etc. I also have an interest in Robotics. My past experience touches fields of task simulation, communication protocols, sensors and ROS.<br><br>

   		I finished my undergradute study at Washington University in St. Louis in Dec 2019. It is my great honor to have worked with two distinguished professors at WUSTL: <a href="https://xzgroup.wustl.edu/people/xuan-silvia-zhang/">Prof. Xuan Zhang</a> and <a href="https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~kunal/">Prof. Kunal Agrawal</a>.
